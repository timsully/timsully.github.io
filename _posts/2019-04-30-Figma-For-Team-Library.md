# Figma Notes
- Figma offers the following team access types: Open, Closed, and Secret.

- Members with view access can comment, inspect, and export assets by default so they can't accidentally edit something

- Secret teams - no one can see secret teams unless invited by members from that secret team or if they're the creator

- User permissions are handled at the team level and cascade down through all projects and documents within it

- If people join a team with edit access, they will be automatically able to edit ALL projects and files in it

- A team could represent an entire department, or a specific project

- Permissions: By structuring teams around efforts, you can have tighter, more specific control of user permissions. For example, if a group of 10 people are working on a new effort, by creating a team just for them, you can isolate edit access to just those users.
