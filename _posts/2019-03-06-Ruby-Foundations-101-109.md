title: Ruby Foundations 101-109 | The PEDAC Process
---

After having read through the Launch School materials pertaining to the PEDAC Process I have found it useful to iterate over how I approach the process of solving the logic layer portion of exercises as I begin my LS/Programming journey.

Before I begin here is an image on the PEDAC Process to provide a general understanding of the process before I interpret it into my own words and how I make sense of the PEDAC process.
