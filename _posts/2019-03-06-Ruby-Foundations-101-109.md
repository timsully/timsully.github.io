title: Ruby Foundations 101-109 | The PEDAC Process
---

After having read through the Launch School materials pertaining to the PEDAC Process I have found it useful to iterate over how I approach the process of solving the logic layer portion of exercises as I begin my LS/Programming journey.

Before I begin here is an image on the PEDAC Process to provide a general understanding of the process before I interpret it into my own words and how I make sense of the PEDAC process.

#### PEDAC
| Objective | Step | Description|
| :--- | :---  | :-----      |
| Process the Problem | Understand the Problem | <ul><li>Identify expected input and output</li><li>Make the requirements explicit</li><li>Identify rules</li><li>Mental model of the problem (optional)</li></ul> |
| | Examples/Test Case | Validate understanding of the problem |
| | Data Structure | How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output. |
| | Algorithm | Steps for converting input to output |
| Code with Intent | Code | Implementation of Algorithm |
