After having read through the Launch School materials pertaining to the PEDAC Process I have found it useful to iterate over how I approach the process of solving the logic layer portion of exercises as I begin my LS/Programming journey.

#### PEDAC Process

Now that you have an image to reference, let's begin. I am going to layout this process in order using a numbered list.

1. Read through the code or question and digest the problem thoroughly.
2. Identify the inputs and outputs for the problem.
3. Define the inputs and outputs values if possible.
4. Write down any implicit requirements.
5. Determine where there needs to be clarifying questions.
6. Come up w/ a mental model to describe it.
7. Come up with Examples/Test Cases
8. Determine what data structures we'll work with to convert the input to output
9. Get the right level of detail to readily convert to code without actually writing code
